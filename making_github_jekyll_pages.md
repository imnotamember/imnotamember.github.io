## General workflow:
1. Head to [GitHub](https://github.com) and login to your account.
1. Follow along with the basic set up at [GitHub's documentation for User/Organization Pages development](https://pages.github.com/)
    * Leave your new repository open, as we'll clone it in the near future.
1. Check if you have Ruby installed on your computer by opening a terminal and typing: `ruby -v` 
    1. If you see a version listing of `2.4.0` or greater, then continue. If it's lower than `2.4.0` than you can upgrade it (doubt this will come up, but stop me if so).
    1. If you get an error, than you must install Ruby development environment:
        1. [Windows Installers](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) - Pick the version that has a **bold link** (newest and most compatible)
            * Confirm it worked by running `ruby -v` in GitBash terminal (Press Windows-Key then search for `git-bash.exe`) 
        1. Mac installation:
            * Enter these commands into terminal:
            ```shell script
           # First, you need to install the command-line tools to be able to compile native extensions, open a terminal and run:
           xcode-select --install
           
           # Install Homebrew
           /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
           brew install ruby
           
           # Add the brew ruby path to your shell config
           export PATH=/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH
           
           # Check to make sure everything installed correctly
           which ruby
           # Should see something like:
           # /usr/local/opt/ruby/bin/ruby
           
           ruby -v
           # Should see something like:
           # ruby 2.6.2p47 (2019-03-13 revision 67232) [x86_64-darwin18]
            ```
        1. Linux (Ubuntu) installation:
            * Enter these commands into terminal:
            ```shell script
            echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.bashrc
            echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"' >> ~/.bashrc
            echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
            source ~/.bashrc
           ```
