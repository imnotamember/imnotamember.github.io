Below are demos of The Z-Box Illusion. This illusion was discovered during the Fall of 2016 by Joshua Zosky and facilitated with help from his advisor, Mike Dodd.

The illusion has been presented at the 2017 VSS Demo Night as "The Box That Defined a Movement."

That same year it was submitted for the "Illusion of the Year Contest." While it didn't place in the top 10, it was thrilling to be able to submit something. The submission video can be seen below.
